## Where does Windows store the auto config URL

Lets say you work somewhere that proxy settings have been automatically configured but the UI is disabled and you can't copy & paste or see the full URL to the PAC to diagnose a problem...

- `\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\AutoConfigURL`
